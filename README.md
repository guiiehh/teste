## Installation
Run npm install (or npm i for the short version) to install the dev dependencies.

## Tests
> **_NOTE:_**  Before running the tests, make a copy of the cypress.env.example.json file as cypress.env.json, which in the real world, you would update with valid credentials.
> The cypress.env.json file is included on .gitignore and you're safe that confidential info won't be versioned.

Run npm test (or npm t for the short version) to run the test in headless mode.

Or, run npm run cy:open to open Cypress in interactive mode.
